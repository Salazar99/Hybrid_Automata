# CHAOS

## Project Overview:

The application is a simulator designed to define a system of concurrent hybrid automata and simulate their behavior over time. The primary objective is to generate output files in .csv format containing the evolution of variables for these hybrid automatas.

## Getting Started:

### Linux

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AldeIT/Hybrid_Automata.git
   cd Hybrid_Automata
   ```

2. **Create and prepare Build Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   export CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja
   export CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   export QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=<path-to-qt-installation-directory>/Qt/<version>/gcc_64/bin/qmake
   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to-qt-installation-directory>/Qt/<version>/gcc_64
   export CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc-11 (choose your own version)
   export CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-g++-11 (choose your own version)
   export CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT=-DQT_QML_DEBUG
   cmake -S <project-directory> -B <build-directory>
   ```
   In case of an error regarding the "QT6Dir" variable or the "QT6ConfigCmake" file you will need to run the following command and then try again:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev
   ```
3. **Build and Run**
   ```bash
   cmake --build <build-directory> --target all
   ./main
   ```

### Windows (to be completed)

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AldeIT/Hybrid_Automata.git
   cd Hybrid_Automata
   ```

2. **Create Build Directory and Compile**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build ./ --config Debug --target ALL_BUILD -j 10
   cd Debug
   ./main.exe
   ```

## How to Use

### Initialize Automata

The following image shows the program's startup window, where various operations can be performed. Let's examine the main ones in detail:

- It's possible to import a configuration file (using the **IMPORT DATA** button) of a previously modeled automaton and view it in the second window, namely Designer.
- It's possible to save the modeled project (using the **SAVE DATA** button).
- It's possible to import the trace of externally defined variables, if available (using the **IMPORT INPUT FILE** button)
- It's possible (and necessary) to set the variables that have been described in the automaton in the Design window through the appropriate value boxes.

![home](/img_md/home.png)

In this second screen, we see how it's possible to model the automata that one wishes to declare.

- It's possible to add new automata by clicking the **+** button (after specifying their names in the appropriate label).
- Each automaton will be marked with a different color (up to 10 automata, then colors will repeat).
- The **COMMANDS** window indicates the commands for executing the main operations.
- Each node requires some information for its initialization, such as instructions, the node name, the node description, and the option to be set as a starter node.
- Each arrow (generated by selecting two circles and pressing the **k** key) requires a condition that can be inserted into the appropriate label.

#### Guide for Instructions

When you need to define instructions to execute inside a node, you need to follow these rules:

1. **Simple Assignment**<br>
   ```plaintext
   x = 5; #no particular rules just remember the ; at the end
   ```
2. **Math Operation**<br>
   ```plaintext
   x = 5 + a; #no particular rules just remember the ; at the end and make sure that the other variable exists
   ```
3. **Differential Equation**<br>
   ```plaintext
   x' = 5*x + a - 0.02; #the derivative is written with the ' after the variable and with no brackets such as "x'(t)", always remember the ; at the end
   ```

![condition](/img_md/condition.png)

#### Guide for Transitions

Delimit with parenthesis and if you need to use the and/or operator you can write conditions like this:

```plaintext
(x<19) & (x+5>=4) #and operator
(x<19) | (x+5>=4) #or operator
```

Some more examples:

```plaintext
((x<19) & (x+5>=4)) & (x+x<6)
(((x<19) | (x+5>=4)) & (2*x>=5)) | (x+1==0)
```

For a complete example with multiple automatas and various types of instructions and conditions you can read the [Watertanks Example](watertanks.json)

### Run Automata

#### Normal Run

In the main window, you can start the execution of the modeled automaton by clicking the **RUN** button after appropriately defining the "Final Time" and the "Delta" (execution step). During execution, the **PAUSE/RESUME** and **STOP** buttons will be enabled.

![run_pausebutton](/img_md/run1.png)

The system's evolution during the run is visible in the Designer screen, where, in addition to seeing in real-time which state the automaton is in, you can also consult the actual values of the calculated variables.

![run](/img_md/run2.png)

We notice how the states in which the automaton is during the execution flash and alternate between the classic color of the node and a darker version. Additionally, you can see at which step the execution is, through the label STEP.

#### Debug Mode

You can start an execution in debug mode, which allows you to run step by step or to perform a designated number of steps. The advantage offered by this mode is the ability to precisely monitor the steps you are most interested in. The steps to start an execution in debug mode are as follows:

- Toggle the **Debug Mode Switch** on the Main screen
- Press the **RUN** button (which will lead the user to the designer screen).

![switch](/img_md/debug_switch.png)

- Click **STEP** to execute one step at a time or enter the number of steps to perform in the appropriate label and then click **DO STEPS**.

![debug_mode](/img_md/step_debug.png)

### Output

You can find the csv output file in the main directory under the name "export.csv".
By default you will also find a "output.json" that contains the automata you have just run, be aware at every execution both the "output.json" and "export.csv" will be overwritten.
And for every execution you'll have to close the two files before hitting the "Run" button.
